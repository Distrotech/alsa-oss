.SH NAME
aoss \- Wrapper script to facilitate use of the ALSA OSS compatibility
library.
.SH SYNOPSYS
\fBaoss\fP \fIosscommand\fP [arguments]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaoss\fP is a simple wrapper script which facilitates the use of the
ALSA OSS compatibility library. It just sets the appropriate LD_PRELOAD
path and then runs the command.

This is useful in cases where routing settings (which can be made in
your .asoundrc file) need to be applied to commands that use the OSS
API.

Examples of asoundrc configuration:

pcm.dsp0 {
	type plug
	slave.pcm "hw:0,0"
}

or

pcm.dsp0 {
	type plug
	slave.pcm "dmix"
}

In the above configuration examples, the pcm.dsp0 definition is used to wrap calls do /dev/dsp0. You can also wrap usage of /dev/dsp1, /dev/dsp2, etc. by defining pcm.dsp1, pcm.dsp2, etc..

In the current form, aoss is not able to wrap OSS applications that make use of libc's FILE* infrastructure (fopen() and friends) for their communication with the OSS sound driver. This is because libc uses internal versions of open() and friends which cannot be intercepted by LD_PRELOAD'ing a shared library..
